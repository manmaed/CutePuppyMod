This mod introduces an adorable new feature: irresistibly Cute Puppys that roam the world with big innocent eyes. Sure, you _can_ kill them to collect rare Puppy Cores essential for crafting powerful swords but honestly, who would want to harm something this heartbreakingly cute?

Still, for the brave (or heartless) adventurer who chooses power over petting, the rewards are tempting. Puppy Cores aren't just rare they're the key to forging some of the most unique weapons in the game. These swords sparkle with a mysterious energy, hinting at the innocent lives they were born from. But every time you swing one, don’t be surprised if you hear a tiny bark echo in the wind… a reminder of the price you paid.
